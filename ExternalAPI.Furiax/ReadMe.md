# External API  

This is an exercise from [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com).  

## Requirements  
Create an ASP.NET Web API and a React frontend that makes a GET request to this API.  

I have chosen to create an API that contains all F1 drivers for the 2025 season and display them on a React page.  

## Goals  
- Practice creating ASP.NET Web APIs.  
- Build a React frontend to get used to working with components, `useState`, and `useEffect`.

## Difficulties
- Making the API in VS22 was easy, and creating the React app in VSC was also straightforward. However, getting them both to run simultaneously in VS22 was quite a journey.
  For some reason, the React code from VSC wasn't showing up in VS22, so I couldn't make it a startup project.
  I had to use Google and ChatGPT's help to finally make it work.
- Experienced some problems getting CORS to work.
