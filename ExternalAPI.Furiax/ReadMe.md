# External API  

This is an exercise from [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com).  

## Requirements  
Create an ASP.NET Web API and a React frontend that makes a GET request to this API.  

I have chosen to create an API that contains all F1 drivers for the 2025 season and display them in a grid on a React page.  

## Goals  
- Practice creating ASP.NET Web APIs.  
- Build a React frontend to practice working with components, `useState`, and `useEffect`.
